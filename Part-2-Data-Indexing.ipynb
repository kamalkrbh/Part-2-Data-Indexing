    "## 1. Data Quality: The Foundation of RAG Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into chunking strategies, it's crucial to understand that **clean, well-structured data is the foundation** of any successful RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "Your data can come from anywhere - the principles remain the same:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Data Sources:**\n",
    "- 📝 **Logs** - Application logs, system logs, audit trails\n",
    "  - *Example*: Server error logs, user activity logs, API request logs\n",
    "- 📄 **PDFs** - Documents, reports, manuals, research papers\n",
    "  - *Example*: Product documentation, scientific papers, legal contracts\n",
    "- 🗄️ **Document Stores** - Confluence, SharePoint, Google Docs\n",
    "  - *Example*: Internal wikis, company policies, team documentation\n",
    "- 🛠️ **Tools & APIs** - Jira, Slack, email archives\n",
    "  - *Example*: Support tickets, team conversations, customer emails\n",
    "- 💾 **Actual Databases** - SQL databases, NoSQL stores, data warehouses\n",
    "  - *Example*: Customer records, product catalogs, transaction histories\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Why Data Quality Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Garbage In = Garbage Out**: No matter how sophisticated your chunking strategy, embedding model, or vector database is, poor quality input data will lead to poor retrieval results and ultimately, poor AI responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-world Impact:**\n",
    "- **Noisy data** (e.g., HTML tags, formatting artifacts) → Embeddings capture irrelevant features → Wrong chunks retrieved\n",
    "- **Inconsistent formatting** (e.g., \"01/12/2024\" vs \"2024-01-12\") → Model can't match related information\n",
    "- **Encoding errors** (e.g., \"donâ€™t\" instead of \"don't\") → Semantic meaning lost → Poor search results\n",
    "- **Duplicate content** → Wastes vector storage space and returns redundant results\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: If your PDF has \"Prïce: $100\" (bad OCR) instead of \"Price: $100\", a user searching for \"product price\" may not find this information because the embedding won't recognize \"Prïce\" as related to \"price\".\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Key Data Quality Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Remove Noise**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strip out unnecessary HTML tags, special characters\n",
    "- Remove duplicate content, headers/footers that repeat\n",
    "- **Clean up OCR errors from scanned documents:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Common OCR Problems:**\n",
    "  - Misrecognized characters (e.g., '0' mistaken for 'O', '1' for 'l', 'rn' for 'm')\n",
    "  - Random symbols and artifacts (stray punctuation, page numbers in text)\n",
    "  - Incorrectly split words across lines\n",
    "  - Lost paragraph structure and formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "  **How to Fix OCR Errors:**\n",
    "  1. **Use spell checkers** - Tools like `textblob`, `pyspellchecker` to catch misrecognized words\n",
    "  2. **Find/Replace patterns** - Use regex to fix common OCR mistakes:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     # Example: Replace common OCR character errors\n",
    "     text = text.replace('0', 'O').replace('rn', 'm')\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Ensure Consistency**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Standardize date formats, units, terminology**\n",
    "  - Dates: \"2024-01-15\" vs \"Jan 15, 2024\" vs \"15/01/24\" → Choose one format\n",
    "  - Units: \"5kg\" vs \"5 kilograms\" vs \"5000g\" → Normalize to consistent unit\n",
    "  - Terminology: \"customer\" vs \"client\" vs \"user\" → Use consistent term\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Fix spelling and grammatical errors**\n",
    "  - Use spell checkers: `textblob`, `pyspellchecker`, or language-specific tools\n",
    "  - Fix common typos that could confuse semantic search\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Normalize text encoding (UTF-8)**\n",
    "  - **Why**: Different encodings (Latin-1, Windows-1252, UTF-16) represent characters differently\n",
    "  - **Problem**: \"café\" in Latin-1 may appear as \"cafÃ©\" when read as UTF-8 (mojibake)\n",
    "  - **Solution**: Detect source encoding and convert everything to UTF-8\n",
    "  - **Tools**: \n",
    "    - `chardet` library to detect encoding\n",
    "    - `ftfy` library to fix encoding errors\n",
    "    - `unicodedata.normalize()` for Unicode normalization (NFC/NFD/NFKC/NFKD)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Preserve Structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maintain logical document hierarchy (headings, sections)\n",
    "- Keep metadata (title, author, date, source)\n",
    "- Preserve context indicators (lists, tables, code blocks)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1 hour of data cleaning can prevent 10+ hours of troubleshooting why your RAG system returns irrelevant answers.\n",

    "## 7.0 Token-Based Chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "Token-based chunking splits text into chunks based on the number of tokens (not characters). This is especially important for LLMs, as most models have token limits and count tokens differently than characters or words.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are tokens**\n",
    "Tokens are not always words; they can be word pieces or punctuation.\n",
    "LLMs process and count input/output in tokens, not characters or words.\n",
    "Token limits (e.g., 4096 tokens for GPT-3.5) determine how much text the model can handle at once.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\"cat\" = 1 token\n",
    "\"unbelievable\" = 3 tokens (\"un\", \"believ\", \"able\")\n",
    "\"Hello, world!\" = 4 tokens (\"Hello\", \",\", \"world\", \"!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key points:**\n",
    "- A token is a unit of text as defined by the tokenizer (e.g., a word, part of a word, or punctuation) this is LLM specific.\n",
    "- Token-based chunking ensures each chunk fits within the model's context window. (In Augmentation Layer for cost optimization)\n",
    "- Common tokenizers: `tiktoken` (OpenAI), Hugging Face tokenizers, etc.\n",
    "- Useful for preparing data for LLMs like GPT-3/4, which have strict token limits.\n",
