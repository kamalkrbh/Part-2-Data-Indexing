    "### 1.2 Hybrid Retrieval (BM25 + Embeddings)\n",
    "\n",
    "Combines keyword matching (BM25) with semantic search for best results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is BM25?**\n",
    "\n",
    "BM25 (Best Matching 25) is a ranking function used in information retrieval that scores documents based on the query terms appearing in each document. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why \"25\"?** The \"25\" simply indicates it's the 25th iteration/variation in the \"Best Matching\" family of ranking functions developed by researchers. Earlier versions included BM1, BM11, BM15, etc. BM25 emerged as the most effective version and became the standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How BM25 works - Key components:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Term Frequency (TF)**: How often a query term appears in a document\n",
    "   - **Query term**: A word from your search query (e.g., if you search \"internet speed\", the query terms are \"internet\" and \"speed\")\n",
    "   - **Diminishing returns**: The relevance benefit of each additional occurrence decreases. Here's why:\n",
    "     - **Real-world intuition**: If you're searching for \"python tutorial\" and find a document:\n",
    "       - With 1 occurrence: \"This Python tutorial covers basics\" → Clearly relevant ✓\n",
    "       - With 3 occurrences: Document discusses Python tutorials multiple times → More relevant ✓✓\n",
    "       - With 100 occurrences: Likely keyword stuffing or spam (\"python python python tutorial tutorial...\") → Not 100x more useful!\n",
    "     - **The problem with linear counting**: If we simply count occurrences, spam documents that repeat words would always rank #1\n",
    "     - **BM25's solution**: Uses a saturation function that increases score rapidly at first, then flattens out\n",
    "     - **Mathematical behavior**: \n",
    "       - 1 occurrence → score: 1.0\n",
    "       - 2 occurrences → score: 1.5 (50% increase)\n",
    "       - 3 occurrences → score: 1.8 (20% increase)\n",
    "       - 5 occurrences → score: 2.1 (smaller increase)\n",
    "       - 100 occurrences → score: 2.5 (barely any increase from 5 to 100!)\n",
    "     - **Key insight**: After ~5-10 occurrences, additional mentions add very little value - the curve \"saturates\"\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**: How rare/common a term is across all documents\n",
    "   - **Inverse**: \"Opposite\" or \"reverse\" - we want RARE terms to score HIGHER\n",
    "   - **Document Frequency**: How many documents contain this term\n",
    "   - **Logic**: If \"the\" appears in 1000/1000 documents, it tells us nothing useful (low IDF weight)\n",
    "   - **Logic**: If \"photosynthesis\" appears in 2/1000 documents, it's highly specific (high IDF weight)\n",
    "   - **Formula**: IDF = log(total_documents / documents_containing_term)\n",
    "   - **Example**: \n",
    "     - \"the\" appears in 950/1000 docs → IDF = log(1000/950) = 0.05 (low weight)\n",
    "     - \"photosynthesis\" appears in 2/1000 docs → IDF = log(1000/2) = 2.7 (high weight)\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Document Length Normalization**: Adjusts scores based on document length\n",
    "   - **Problem**: Longer documents naturally contain more words, giving them unfair advantage\n",
    "   - **Solution**: Normalize scores by document length relative to average document length\n",
    "   - **Example**: A 1000-word document with 3 matches isn't necessarily better than a 100-word document with 2 matches\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Hybrid (BM25 + Embeddings)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BM25 strengths**: Excellent at finding exact keyword/phrase matches (e.g., \"Article 5\", \"GDP growth\")\n",
    "- **Embedding strengths**: Understands semantic meaning and synonyms (e.g., \"WiFi\" ≈ \"internet\", \"quick\" ≈ \"fast\")\n",
    "- **Combined**: Handles both \"WiFi requirements\" and \"internet speed needs\" queries effectively"

    "### 2. Query Expansion: Improving Retrieval with Better Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Users often ask queries in ways that don't match document terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- User: \"How fast should my internet be?\" → Document: \"minimum bandwidth requirements\"\n",
    "- User: \"WFH guidelines\" → Document: \"remote work policy\"\n",
    "- User: \"What's needed for home office?\" → Document: \"equipment specifications\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Use an LLM to expand or rewrite queries for better matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### LLM-Based Query Expansion\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Intelligent Synonyms**: LLMs understand context and generate appropriate synonyms\n",
    "   - \"fast internet\" → \"high-speed connection, broadband, bandwidth requirements\"\n",

    "2. **Acronym Handling**: Automatically expands abbreviations\n",
    "   - \"WFH\" → \"work from home, remote work, telecommuting\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Contextual Rewriting**: Rephrases queries to match document style\n",
    "   - \"How fast should internet be?\" → \"internet speed requirements, minimum bandwidth specifications\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Multi-Query Generation**: Creates diverse query variations\n",

    "## 4. Context Filtering: Deciding Relevance to Query Intent\n",
    "\n",
    "Context filtering ensures that retrieved chunks are actually relevant to the user's intent and the needs of the downstream application. This step is crucial for improving the quality of answers and reducing irrelevant or distracting information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Context Filtering Techniques (Theory)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Similarity Threshold Filtering:**\n",
    "  - Only include chunks whose similarity or relevance score (from hybrid or cross-encoder reranker) is above a certain threshold.\n",
    "  - Lower thresholds include more context (risking noise), higher thresholds are stricter (risking missing useful info).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Top-N Filtering:**\n",
    "  - Return only the top N most relevant chunks, regardless of their absolute score.\n",
    "  - Useful for limiting context size for LLMs or downstream models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Metadata Filtering:**\n",
    "  - Use metadata fields (e.g., document type, user role, department, date) to include or exclude chunks.\n",
    "  - Example: Only show policy documents to HR users, or filter by recent date for time-sensitive queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intent Detection and Filtering:**\n",
    "  - Classify the user's query to understand what kind of information they are seeking (e.g., 'policy', 'requirements', 'troubleshooting').\n",
    "  - Filter or boost chunks that match the detected intent, either by keyword, metadata, or LLM-based classification.\n",
    "  - Suppose a user query is:\n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "      > \"What are the troubleshooting steps for slow internet?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Step 1: Detect Intent**\n",
    "    - Use simple keyword matching or rules:\n",
    "      - If the query contains words like \"troubleshooting\", \"fix\", \"resolve\", classify intent as `troubleshooting`.\n",
    "      - If the query contains \"requirements\", intent is `requirements`.\n",
    "      - If the query contains \"policy\", intent is `policy`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    After retrieval, only include or boost chunks that mention the intent keyword (e.g., \"troubleshooting\") or are tagged as such in metadata.\n",
    "    Such filtering can be done using LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Timeline Filtering:**\n",
    "  - Filter or prioritize chunks based on recency or time relevance (e.g., only include documents from the last year).\n"
